Unlike G*Power, PowerAnalyses is open source and can, therefore, be more easily improved and verified. Compared to pwr, this package contains more analyses and thanks to Julia's multiple dispatch the code of this package is simpler, that is, the code is less prone to errors.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Getting-started","page":"PowerAnalyses","title":"Getting started","text":"This package can be installed via:\n\nusing Pkg\n\nPkg.add(\"PowerAnalyses\")\n\nand allows you to determine one of the following parameters:\n\nsample size n\npower\nsignificance level alpha\neffect size es\n\nwhen knowing the other three parameters.\n\nFor example, to calculate the required sample size for a two tailed t-test, we can use the OneSampleTTest type:\n\nusing PowerAnalyses\n\nes = 0.5\nalpha = 0.05\npower = 0.95\n\nT = OneSampleTTest(two_tails)\nget_n(T; alpha, power, es)","category":"section"},{"location":"#Functions","page":"PowerAnalyses","title":"Functions","text":"The functions for determining the parameters take the following arguments:","category":"section"},{"location":"#Tests","page":"PowerAnalyses","title":"Tests","text":"The following tests are implemented:","category":"section"},{"location":"#PowerAnalyses.get_power","page":"PowerAnalyses","title":"PowerAnalyses.get_power","text":"get_power(T::StatisticalTest; es::Real, alpha::Real, n)\n\nReturn the power for some test T with effect size es, required significance level alpha and sample size n.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#PowerAnalyses.get_alpha","page":"PowerAnalyses","title":"PowerAnalyses.get_alpha","text":"get_alpha(T::StatisticalTest; es::Real, power::Real, n)\n\nReturn the significance level for some test T with effect size es, power power and sample size n.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#PowerAnalyses.get_es","page":"PowerAnalyses","title":"PowerAnalyses.get_es","text":"get_es(T::StatisticalTest; alpha::Real, power::Real, n)\n\nReturn the minimum effect size for some test T with significance level alpha, power power and sample size n.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#PowerAnalyses.get_n","page":"PowerAnalyses","title":"PowerAnalyses.get_n","text":"get_n(T::StatisticalTest; alpha::Real, power::Real, es::Real)\n\nReturn minimum sample size n for some test T with significance level alpha, power power and effect size es.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#PowerAnalyses.ConstantVarianceChisqTest","page":"PowerAnalyses","title":"PowerAnalyses.ConstantVarianceChisqTest","text":"ConstantVarianceChisqTest(tail::Tail) <: ChisqTest\n\nChi-square test for determining whether the population variance σ² equals a specific (constant) value.
